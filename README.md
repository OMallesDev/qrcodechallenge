## My process

Definitely some minor paint points in my process that took me a bit to get the hang of. One of the biggest roadblocks was getting flexbox to work so that way the mobile version didn't have blank space and a scroll bar. And although I kinda beat myself up a bit over it it was definitely something that needed worked on.

```css
//body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-content: center; //

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I definitely need to continue focusing and learning the flexbox method. It really helped when I was struggling with a mobile issue that I couldn't seem to fix any other way. Definitely just overall need to continue practicing and learning the "best ways to do things.

## Acknowledgments

Honestly I only have inspiration because of my friend Tyler. He's the one who has constantly pushed me to be better and do better throughout my life and he's the reason why even at the age of 35 I'm trying something new and learning.
